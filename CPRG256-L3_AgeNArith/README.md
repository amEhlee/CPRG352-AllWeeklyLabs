<h3>Age and Arithmetic Calculator</h3>

First smaller test lab using netbeans where we were tasked on making an age and aritmetic calculator. I used a bit of CSS to make things look better for fun.

<h3>Age Calculator</h3>
The age calculator portion allows the user to give an age and returns the age they will be on their next birthday.<br></br>

The aritmetic calculator portion allows the user to calculate the value of any two part equation only having basic operators like: add, subtract, multiply and divide<br></br>
