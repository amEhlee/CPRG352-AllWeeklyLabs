# CPRG352-Lab7-9_JPA

Given the template lab 7 this is my version of the same lab except using JPA and eclipseLink for database interaction. 
Everything should work the same as the original lab using JDBC except just a teensy bit cleaner.

P.S the connection pool class is useless at this point and will be removed at a later date following further refactoring 

Enjoy!
